# User Journey Documentation

## MVP Current User Journey (as observed)
1. **Landing Page** – The user lands on the **Onboarding page**.
2. **Input Form** – The page presents three input fields:
   - Birth date (Geburtsdatum)
   - Birth time (Geburtszeit)
   - Birth location (Geburtsort)
3. **Calculate** – After filling all fields the user clicks the **"Berechnen"** button.
4. **Success Popup** – A modal appears with the message:
   > "Congratulations you opened your path through your cosmic constellation!"
   The user dismisses it by clicking **"OK"**.
5. **Results Section** – The UI scrolls one screen‑height down, revealing a section that displays:
   - All zodiac signs
   - Horoscope interpretations
   - Various astrological insights
6. **Create Artifact** – The user can now click **"Wertstück erschaffen"**.
7. **Agent Layer** – While the artifact is being created, the **Agent layer** appears showing two bronze‑colored agent tiles:
   - The generated symbol
   - Text: "Choose your companion.\nYou merged ZODIAC and BAZI"

## Expected MVP User Journey (desired flow)
| Step | Expected Action | Expected Outcome |
|------|----------------|------------------|
| 1 | User navigates to the onboarding page | Landing page loads correctly |
| 2 | User enters birth date, time, location | Form validates inputs in real‑time |
| 3 | User clicks **Berechnen** | Engine computes BaZi and Western charts |
| 4 | Success modal appears with congratulatory text | User acknowledges via **OK** |
| 5 | UI automatically scrolls to results section | All zodiac signs, horoscopes, and interpretations are displayed |
| 6 | User clicks **Wertstück erschaffen** | System generates a personalized symbol/artifact |
| 7 | Agent layer shows two bronze tiles with the generated symbol and the text "Choose your companion. You merged ZODIAC and BAZI" | User can proceed to next interaction |

## Gap Analysis
- The **observed flow** already matches the **expected flow** in terms of steps and UI elements.
- Minor improvements could be added:
  - Real‑time validation feedback for the input fields.
  - Smooth scrolling animation when moving to the results section.
  - Accessibility enhancements (ARIA labels, focus management for the modal).
